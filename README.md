# Classic-Pong-Game
Project Overview:
This project will recreate the classic Pong game in Python, offering a simple, two-player experience similar to the original arcade game. The goal is to develop a fully functional version of Pong with easy-to-understand code, making it an ideal project for beginners to learn the basics of game programming.
Target Audience:
Casual Gamers looking for a simple, nostalgic game experience.
Beginner Programmers interested in learning game development with Python, especially those new to Pygame.

Game Features:
Basic Gameplay Mechanics:
The game consists of two paddles and a ball. Each player controls a paddle (one on the left side, one on the right) using keyboard controls to move up and down.
The objective is to prevent the ball from passing each player’s paddle by blocking it. If the ball passes one player’s paddle, the other player scores a point.
Score Display:
A simple scoreboard will show the current score of both players, updating whenever a player scores a point. The game can be set to end when a player reaches a specified score, such as 10 points.
Basic Ball and Paddle Mechanics:
The ball will bounce off the top and bottom of the screen and change direction when it hits a paddle, similar to the original Pong.
Basic physics will control the ball’s speed and direction, ensuring a smooth and fair experience for both players.
